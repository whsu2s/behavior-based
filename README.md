# behavior-based
Behavior-based robotics or behavioral robotics is an approach in robotics 
that focuses on robots that are able to exhibit complex-appearing behaviors 
despite little internal variable state to model its immediate environment, 
mostly gradually correcting its actions via sensory-motor links.
